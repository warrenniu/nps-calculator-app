# Overview

This project calculates your NPS score by tallying up your responses and subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. The score is a whole number that ranges from -100 to 100, and indicates customer happiness with your brand experience.

To use the application, enter your scores in the first row, "Count the Responses". The scores are automatically grouped in row two, "Group the Responses", and calculated in row three, "Calculate your NPS"
